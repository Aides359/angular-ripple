angular-ripple
==============

A pure javascript (no polymer, no jQuery) AngularJS directive that adds a Google Material Design ripple effect when clicked or touched.

[Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org/) is cool, but sometimes you just want the ripple effect in your angular app without all the bloat. Thatâ€™s why we made this.

# Demo

Here's a <a href="http://nelsoncash.github.io/angular-ripple">demo</a>

# Bower

    $ bower install --save ngRipple


# Usage

Include the script in your HTML

    <script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/ngRipple/ngRipple.js"></script>

Then include `ngRipple` in your module dependencies

    angular.module('yourApp', ['ngRipple']);

Then add the `ng-ripple` attribute to elements

    <button ng-ripple>Ripple!</button>
